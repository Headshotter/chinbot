This is chinbot. 
This is the rewrite of the previous chinbot which was pure [jenni](https://github.com/myano/jenni/wiki) but kept on crashing so its kind of mostly based on [phenny](https://github.com/sbp/phenny) now .

Instructions

1) Run ./phenny - this creates a default config file

2) Edit ~/.phenny/default.py

3) Run ./phenny - this now runs phenny with your settings


Enjoy!
